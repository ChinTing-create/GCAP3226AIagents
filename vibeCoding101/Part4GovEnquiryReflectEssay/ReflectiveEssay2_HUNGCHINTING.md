## Reflective Essay 2: Government Data Access and Project Experience

Accessing government data for our project gave me new insights into Hong Kong’s data governance. While basic statistics are openly available, more detailed or policy-relevant data often require formal requests under the Code on Access to Information. This process revealed both improvements and ongoing barriers in open data practices.

Drafting enquiry letters taught me the importance of clear, purposeful requests. Well-structured questions not only increase the chance of a positive response but also enhance the project’s credibility. As researchers, our right to information is vital for producing persuasive and authoritative work.

This project improved my writing, critical thinking, and analytical skills. Teamwork was essential for identifying data needs and refining our approach. I also learned that proper data management is crucial for future research.

Collaborating with the AI agent was a unique experience. The agent provided tailored guidance and resources, which helped clarify requirements and improve my research and writing. Compared to a standard chatbot tutor, the AI agent offered more context-aware support and boosted my confidence in using digital tools.

Access to government data will strengthen our analysis. If our request is denied, we will use secondary sources or adjust our research questions. Overall, this experience deepened my understanding of data-driven policymaking and the steps needed to obtain and use public data effectively.
