## Reflective Essay 2: Government Data Access and Project Experience

Reflecting on the process of accessing government data for our project, I gained valuable insights into Hong Kong’s data governance. While some datasets are openly available, such as basic demographic statistics, more detailed or policy-relevant data often require formal requests under the Code on Access to Information. This highlighted both the progress and limitations of the government’s open data practices—transparency is improving, but barriers remain for researchers seeking comprehensive information.

Drafting the enquiry letter was a challenging yet rewarding experience. Identifying the exact data needed required careful review of policy documents and existing datasets. Crafting a professional and respectful request taught me the importance of clarity and formality in government communication. I learned how to structure questions to maximize the chance of a helpful response, and the process deepened my appreciation for information rights.

Working with the AI agent was a unique aspect of this project. The agent provided guidance on drafting, suggested resources, and helped clarify requirements. Compared to a standard chatbot tutor, the AI agent offered more tailored, context-aware support, which improved my research and writing skills. This collaboration enhanced my digital literacy and confidence in using AI tools for academic work.

Access to government data will significantly strengthen our project analysis. If our request is denied, we plan to use secondary sources or adjust our research questions. Overall, this experience has deepened my understanding of data-driven policymaking and the practical steps required to obtain and use public data effectively.
